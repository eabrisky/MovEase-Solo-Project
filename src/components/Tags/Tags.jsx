                The movie Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),
                released in 2014 and directed by Alejandro G.
                Iñárritu, was shot on digital using ARRI ALEXA XT Camera,
                ARRI ALEXA XT M Camera and Leica Summilux-C Series Lenses,
                Zeiss Master Prime Lenses with Emmanuel Lubezki as cinematographer
                and editing was done on the Avid Editing System by Douglas Crise,
                Stephen Mirrione.
                
                Like Gravity, and other films Lubezki shot, including Tree of Life and Children of Men,
                Birdman is known for its long takes—single, seemingly unedited shots of
                several minutes or more in length. In fact, Lubezki and writer/director
                Alejandro González Iñárritu worked very hard to make Birdman seem like
                it was shot entirely in a single, continuous take.
                
                This was achieved by combining several long takes and making their transitions
                as hidden and seamless as possible. For the most part, it was successful,
                and is considered a major factor in Birdman’s considerable award season praise.

                While the film used camera tricks and illusion to make Birdman seem like a
                two-hour-plus single take, it still involved several long shots that are
                incredibly difficult to film in a practical setting.
                According to Lubezki, most shots are around ten minutes in length with the
                longest take around fifteen. Even a single one of these takes would be
                considered a daunting and possibly unnecessary task in a production.

                How did the Birdman team (Birdteam?) pull this off? With lots of practice.
                A proxy set resembling the labyrinthine backstage hallways of the
                St. James Theatre—where Birdman is set—was built in Los Angeles before
                filming began. It was there that Iñárritu and Lubezki blocked out each shot,
                playing Birdman’s jazzy, drum-based score in the background to help set the tone.
                By plotting and practicing each long take,
                the filmmakers were able to figure out how and where they could
                hide their shot transitions, as well as get an idea of where to
                stage their actors and place their lights.
                They realized for the more difficult shots, visual effects would be needed
                to help with the transition.
